## Colour Picker

This neural network example uses simple matrix maths and basic back propagation training in order to correctly judge whether white or black text should be used with a random colour background.

Due to the complexity of the networks decision, there is a larger dataset used which is imported from another file. This can then be visualised by a basic ui.
